<h2>About this project</h2>
A simple Ruby on Rails blog project, which is part of the course "The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course".
For the authentication and authorization part, I used the gems devise and pundit.
For the front-end, I mainly used my own styles, but also had a lot of help from Bootstrap!

<h2>Technologies used</h2>
Ruby on rails and Bootstrap

<h2>About registrations</h2>
I deleted the :registerable option in the users model, so currently only users
with a valid account can create articles. However, anybody can view the articles
and the different user profiles

<h2>Future implementations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    -Add a functionality so that users can upload as many photos (or gifs!) as they want
    and include them inside the article. I would like to add different font styles, fonts
    and colors...!
  </li>
  <li>
    - There is always room to implement the design... I want to redesign the users profile page, buttons and add some nice banners for each article.
  </li>
</ul>
